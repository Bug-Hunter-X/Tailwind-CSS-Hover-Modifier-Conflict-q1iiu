# Tailwind CSS Hover Modifier Conflict
This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS hover modifiers.  The problem arises from either conflicting styles or an incorrect class order that prevents the hover effect from working as expected. The solution involves carefully reviewing and adjusting the class order and style definitions to achieve the desired visual behavior.

## Bug Description
The hover effect on a button element might not apply correctly, appear partially applied, or be overridden by other styles. This can lead to unexpected behavior and a poor user experience.

## Solution
The solution typically involves:

1. **Reviewing class order:** Ensure that the hover modifier class (`hover:bg-blue-700`) is applied after the base class (`bg-blue-500`). Tailwind CSS processes classes in order.
2. **Checking for conflicting styles:** Inspect the CSS rules affecting the element in your browser's developer tools. Identify any conflicting styles or rules that might override the hover effect. 
3. **Specificity:**  Use more specific selectors to override conflicting styles. Add `!important` as a last resort.  It's generally advised to avoid `!important` if possible to ensure maintainability.
4. **Using `@apply` (if applicable):** If you are using custom directives, consider using `@apply` to correctly apply your styles.
